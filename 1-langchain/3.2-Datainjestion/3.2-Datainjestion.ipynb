Recent reasoning LLMs (Li et al., 2025b) such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-\\nAI et al., 2025) have significantly improved mathematical problem-solving through their\\nreasoning tokens encompassing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). These models continuously\\nscrutinize their own computational processes, boosting their self-correction capability (Ku-\\nmar et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024; YAO et al., 2024), which enhances accuracy\\nand reliability in the reasoning. This inspires us to explore the effects of incorporating minor\\nerrors into reasoning traces and evaluating how well the models can self-correct. Therefore,\\na critical question emerges: how vulnerable are these advanced reasoning LLMs to subtle\\nerrors in their input reasoning chains?\\nWe investigate this problem by examining how reasoning LLMs respond when presented\\nwith reasoning tokens containing tampered calculation results. Our findings reveal a\\nconcerning vulnerability we term \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT): when provided with\\nreasoning tokens incorporating manipulated calculation results at the ends of reasoning\\nlogic steps, models tend to undergo thinking confusion, ignore the correct reasoning steps\\nand adopt the incorrect results instead. Even when models initially demonstrate strong\\ninclination toward the correct answer during their reasoning process, the final result may\\n∗Work done during internship at UC Merced NLP Lab.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2503.19326v2  [cs.AI]  1 Apr 2025\\nPreprint.

When the same model is presented with\\nthe same problem but with subtly tampered reasoning tokens (changing just one digit in\\nthe final product) as its previous thinking, it produces a new reasoning chain with illogical\\ncalculation steps. In addition, the final result content includes the correct steps and incorrect\\nproduct. This inconsistency demonstrates how endpoint tampering of input reasoning\\nchain can override the model’s own reasoning capabilities. This vulnerability has important\\nimplications for the reliability of reasoning LLMs. The self-correction of LLMs is crucial for\\nenhancing their reasoning robustness. However, our work shows that current reasoning\\nLLMs, despite their advances, remain susceptible to being misled by tampered tokens,\\ncompromising their self-correction abilities.\\nTo systematically study this phenomenon, we design three increasingly explicit prompting\\nmethods to encourage models to scrutinize the tampered reasoning tokens. Our experiments\\nacross multiple reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o1(Jaech et al., 2024), o3-mini1,\\nand others) reveal that these models have difficulties in identifying wrong answers in the\\nreasoning tokens, and struggle significantly to resist CPT.\\nOur investigation into CPT reveals an interesting contrast with recent work (Li et al., 2025a)\\non reasoning chains. While existing research suggests global structural alterations to long\\nCoT more significantly impact model performance than local content modifications, we find\\nthat in reasoning vulnerabilities, endpoint token manipulations can have greater effects than\\nstructural changes. Some structural modifications even enhance CPT resistance. Addition-\\nally, we discovered that when presented with tampered reasoning tokens for mathematical\\nword problems, DeepSeek-R1 may experience \"thinking stopped\"—completely ceasing its\\nreasoning process without producing a final answer. This is a security vulnerability in\\nmodel reasoning that deserves attention.\\nAbove all, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We focus on mathematical\\nproblem-solving and introduce a new research question: how well can reasoning LLMs\\nperform even in the presence of minor errors introduced in the input reasoning tokens? (2)\\nWe define the new concept of CPT and demonstrate, based on three approaches, that existing\\nreasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT; (3) We find that local ending token modifications\\nhave a greater impact on model reasoning than structural changes, which is contrary to\\nthe existing research; (4) Based on our tampered reasoning tokens, we find a security\\nvulnerability that DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to produce the final result.\\n1https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini\\n2\\nPreprint.

(2025b) discusses the evolution of different reasoning\\nLLMs and provides the comprehensive performance comparison of typical reasoning LLMs.\\n(Chen et al., 2025b) provides a summary of Long CoT, highlighting its main features, includ-\\ning deep reasoning, feasible reflection, and extensive exploration.\\nResistance of LLMs to Errors in Reasoning It is crucial to study the impact of introducing\\nminor mistakes in the reasoning process and analyze the effectiveness of the self-correction\\nof models. Mukherjee et al. (2025) focuses on improving the error identification ability of\\nLLMs in the reasoning chain. Li et al. (2025a) indicates that the structure of the long CoT is\\nvital for LLMs to learning, while small tampering to local content (for instance, the accuracy\\nof the final answer and the numerical values) do not substantially affect model performance.\\nHowever, our work reaches an opposing conclusion to some extent. In addition, many\\nstudies focus on the mathematical reasoning ability evaluation (Yuan et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2024; Li et al., 2024) of LLMs. He et al. (2025) systematically studies the ability of LLMs to\\ndetect errors in long CoT reasoning, and finds that there will be calculation error, reasoning\\nerror and understanding errors in the inference of mathematical problems. But there is\\nstill relatively little research on evaluation and improvement of the model’s capability to\\nreflect and self-correct mistakes in the reasoning process (Chen et al., 2025a). Moreover, the\\nreasoning tokens may not only contain errors, but may also be inconsistent with the final\\nresults given by the reasoning LLMs (Zhou et al., 2025).\\n3\\nMethodology\\nWhen reasoning LLMs solve mathematical problems, they generate detailed reasoning\\nsteps leading to a final answer. We propose \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) to describe a\\nvulnerability where models adopt incorrect results from tampered reasoning tokens despite\\ntheir ability to calculate correctly. This behavior raises important questions about how these\\nmodels integrate prior information with current reasoning processes.\\nTo systematically investigate CPT, we first analyze the structure of reasoning tokens in\\nmathematical problem-solving (Section 3.1), then formalize the concept of CPT and develop\\nmetrics to quantify its impact (Section 3.2). We explain our approach to tampering with\\nreasoning tokens (Section 3.3), evaluate methods to enhance model resistance (Section 3.4),\\nand investigate how structural modifications affect CPT (Section 3.5).\\n3.1\\nInitial Observations on Reasoning Token Vulnerabilities\\nWhen evaluating reasoning LLMs on mathematical problems, we discovered that models\\npresented with reasoning chains containing subtle calculation errors often adopt these\\nincorrect results in their outputs, despite their ability to calculate correctly. For example,\\nwhen DeepSeek-R1 correctly solved 38,697,082 × 4,133,991, changing just one digit in\\nthe result tokens (from 159,973,388,714,262 to 159,973,389,714,262) caused it to adopt this\\nincorrect value in subsequent reasoning.\\nThis behavior appeared across multiple models, particularly when modifications targeted\\n\"loop ending result\" tokens - the numerical conclusions at critical points in reasoning. This\\nobservation raised a key question: How do reasoning LLMs prioritize between their own\\ncalculation abilities and presented calculation results? This apparent vulnerability forms the\\nbasis of our \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) concept formalized in the following section.\\n3.2\\nCPT of Reasoning LLMs\\nWe formalize CPT as follows: Given a mathematical problem q0, we first establish that a\\nreasoning LLM can correctly solve it, generating accurate reasoning tokens rt0 and final\\nanswer s0. We then create tampered tokens rtT by modifying specific calculation results in\\nthe ending tokens of rt0 while preserving the reasoning steps. When these tampered tokens\\n3\\nPreprint. Under review.\\nare presented alongside the original problem to the models in LM, we observe whether\\nthe model’s new reasoning tokens rtc and answer sc align with the correct answer w or are\\ninfluenced by the tampered information (Algorithm 1). It should be noted that we require\\nthe initial reasoning tokens rtm and final result sm to be correct, meaning that the evaluated\\nmodel itself has the ability to correctly solve q0. Otherwise, it is unreasonable to investigate\\nwhether it is affected by CPT.\\nTo quantify CPT susceptibility, we define the compromising rate:\\nrCPT =\\nDT\\n2DT −DCPT\\n∈[0.5, 1],\\n(1)\\nwhere DT is the number of tampered digits and DCPT is the number of digits in the model’s\\noutput matching our tampered digits rather than the correct result. For instance, with a\\nsingle-digit modification (DT = 1), a value of rCPT = 1 indicates complete compromise,\\nwhile rCPT = 0.5 shows complete resistance. Specifically, when CPT causes severe reasoning\\nconfusion in models, i.e. DT < DCPT (see the instance 5 and 6 in Appendix A), rCPT = 2.\\nThe aggregate compromising rate RCPT across n evaluation results is calculated as:\\nRCPT = 1\\nn\\nn\\n∑\\ni=1\\nrCPT,i\\n(2)\\n3.3\\nTampering with Reasoning Tokens\\nAlgorithm 1: CPT Research\\nInput: Reasoning LLM set LM, question\\nq0, method Tamper for tampering with\\nending tokens, correct answer w to q0.\\nOutput: Result s.\\ns := ∅\\n(rt0, s0) ←M(q0)\\n▷M ∈LM.\\nrtT ←Tamper(rt0)\\nqT ←q0∥rtT\\nfor j = 0 to length(LM) −1 do\\n(rtm, sm) ←LMj(q0)\\nif w ⊆sm then\\n(rtc, sc) ←LMj(qT)\\nif sc ==⊥then\\nr ←⊥\\n▷Thinking stopped.\\ncontinue\\nelse\\nr ←Compare(rtm, rtc, sm, sc)\\nend\\nelse\\nr ←⊥\\ncontinue\\nend\\ns ←s ∪r\\nend\\nreturn s\\nTo systematically study CPT, we need a principled\\napproach to create tampered reasoning tokens. As\\nillustrated in Figure 2, reasoning tokens typically\\ncontain calculation loops, self-reflection, and self-\\nverification components. Our tampering strategy\\nspecifically targets the \"loop ending result\" tokens\\n- the numerical conclusions at critical points in the\\nreasoning process.\\nWe implement digit substitution as our primary\\nmethod,\\ncarefully modifying specific digits in\\ncalculation results while maintaining the origi-\\nnal format and length.\\nFor example, changing\\n\"711,025,910,075,981\" to \"711,025,710,075,981\" by re-\\nplacing ’9’ with ’7’. The instances are shown in Ap-\\npendix C. This method creates subtle numerical dis-\\ncrepancies that challenge the model’s ability to recon-\\ncile its own calculations with presented information.\\nAfter evaluating alternative approaches, we found\\nthat digit substitution is optimal for studying CPT,\\nas methods that alter result length (insertion or dele-\\ntion) tend to trigger format validation mechanisms\\nrather than testing numerical reasoning fidelity. By\\npreserving the structure and only modifying specific\\nresult digits, we can directly assess how reasoning\\nLLMs prioritize between their own calculations and\\nexternally provided conclusions.\\n3.4\\nProbing LLM Resistance to CPT\\nTo evaluate how effectively reasoning LLMs can resist CPT, we developed three increasingly\\ndirect interventions (Figure 3):\\n• Method 1 (Uncertainty Prompting): Uses filter text suggesting possible errors in the\\nreasoning tokens.\\n4\\nPreprint.

Since reasoning tokens are often not directly accessible in API-based interactions, we\\nfocus our analysis on final outputs for this condition. These interventions create a systematic\\nframework for measuring CPT resistance across models and mathematical problem types.\\nComplete examples of model responses across these conditions are provided in Appendix B.\\nMy previous thinking is incorrect, especially the final result. \\nTherefore, I should ignore my previous reasoning and rethink.\\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\"deepseek-reasoner\",\\n  messages=[\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<Question>+<Input Suffix>\"},\\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":\"<Output Prefix>\", \"prefix\": True}])\\nprint(\"result: \", response.choices[0].message.content)\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nMethod 2\\nCode\\nOutput \\nPrefix\\nMethod 1: Uncertainty Prompting\\nMethod 2: Direct Contradiction\\nMethod 3: Output Prefix Control\\nBelow is your previous thought.

We consider self-reflection and self-verification\\ncomponents (Figure 2) as integral reasoning units. For deleted reasoning steps, we imple-\\nment two approaches: Delete-R (removing only self-reflection) and Delete-V (removing only\\nself-verification). For inserted reasoning steps, we introduce extraneous reasoning tokens\\nrelated to angle calculation between the self-reflection and self-verification components.\\nIf structural modifications have a more significant impact than content modifications on\\nreasoning outcomes, we would expect the model’s ability to resist CPT to be substantially\\nweakened when the structure is altered, leading to increased compromising thinking proba-\\nbility. Conversely, if local content modifications prove more influential, structural changes\\nmight have minimal effect or even potentially enhance CPT resistance. Through these struc-\\ntural modifications, we aim to test whether the conclusions from prior work on reasoning\\nchain structure extend to the CPT phenomenon, or whether result token modifications\\nrepresent a distinct vulnerability that operates through different mechanisms.\\n2https://api-docs.deepseek.com\\n5\\nPreprint.

Our research requires an in-depth analysis of the reasoning tokens generated\\nby reasoning LLMs. Since most model APIs do not allow direct access to these tokens,\\nautomated evaluation is difficult and extensive human assessment is required. As a result,\\nour experimental dataset is relatively concise and precise. For standalone arithmetic tasks\\n(Shrestha et al., 2025), we focus on addition and multiplication problems and construct a\\ntest dataset containing 15-digit plus 13-digit addition and 8-digit by 7-digit multiplication\\nvia random number generation. For mathematical word problems, we randomly selected 6\\nrepresentative questions (see Appendix E) from GSM-Ranges (Shrestha et al., 2025) with\\nlevel 6 perturbation to build a subset for evaluation.\\nModels. We evaluate multiple reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3-min,\\nKimi k1.5 (long-CoT) (Team et al., 2025), Doubao (Deep Thinking) 3, and OpenAI-o1. To\\nacquire reasoning tokens, the models were accessed through their respective APIs using\\ndefault temperature settings and web-based conversations.\\nBenchmark. We conduct experimental evaluation following Algorithm 1, and use the\\nquestioning method illustrated in Figure 1 as our baseline. This baseline simply appends\\nthe question to the manipulated reasoning tokens by using a basic filter (i.e., \"Below is your\\nprevious thought.\"). We compare the baseline with three methods (Method 1-3) designed\\nto resist CPT. For mathematical calculation tasks, we adopt manipulated reasoning tokens\\nwith different levels of tampering, defined by DT ∈[1, 6]. We focus on the DT = 1 case\\nfor mathematical word problems, due to the complex numerical and logical structures of\\nthe tokens. To better demonstrate the impact of the CPT issue, we use DeepSeek-R1 for\\nM in Algorithm 1, as its generated long CoT exhibits a more rigorous and comprehensive\\nreasoning process.\\nEvaluation Protocol. For each model and problem combination, we first verify that the\\nmodel can correctly solve the problem independently. Then, following Algorithm 1, we\\npresent the model with the same problem appended with tampered reasoning tokens and\\nmeasure the compromising rate as defined in Equation 1. For structural modification\\nexperiments, we implement three variants (Delete-R, Delete-V, and Insertion) as described\\nin Section 3.5 and evaluate their impact on CPT resistance.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nIn Figure 4, we present the RCPT evaluation results for the reasoning LLMs performing both\\naddition and multiplication at various DT values. As far as we know, Doubao model cannot\\nimplement the output prefix method under deep-thinking, so its evaluation data for Method\\n3 are omitted and thus displayed as a zero value in Figure 5. Overall, Method 3 substantially\\noutperforms Method 1 and Method 2 in improving models’ resistance to CPT. Under the\\nbaseline condition, all models are noticeably affected by CPT, with DeepSeek-R1 being the\\nmost susceptible. For DeepSeek-R1, cases under Method 3 arise in which DT is lower than\\nDCPT, causing RCPT to exceed the baseline. This indicates that under the output prefix\\napproach, DeepSeek-R1’s mathematical computation capabilities are not robust enough.\\nFurthermore, it can be clearly observed that resistance to CPT generally strengthens as DT\\nincreases.\\n3https://www.doubao.com/chat\\n6\\nPreprint.

In Figure 8, we illustrate the reasoning performance of reasoning\\nLLMs for additive calculation under CPT setting and structural modifications on reasoning\\ntokens. Compared with the baseline method, all three approaches of modifying structure\\nimprove the model’s resistance to CPT. Among these approaches, Delete-R achieves optimal\\nperformance. Therefore, structural modifications are unlikely to significantly enhance the\\nimpact of CPT. This finding also suggests that for the CPT problem, local ending token\\nmanipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural alterations, which\\npartially conflicts with previous work (Li et al., 2025a) to some extent.\\n7\\nPreprint.

This section will further analyze these results, focusing on the additional\\nfindings and new contributions derived from them. We first investigate the impact of\\nvarying degrees of manipulation on CPT (Section 5.1), and then analyze the nature of CPT’s\\neffect on model reasoning (Section 5.2). Finally, we reveal a security vulnerability that\\nmanipulated tokens can lead DeepSeek-R1 to stop reasoning and fail to deliver a final\\nanswer (Section 5.3).\\n5.1\\nImpact of Different Degrees of Tampering on CPT\\nIn our experiments, along with the increasing of the number of tampered digits in ending\\nreasoning tokens, the reasoning LLMs become more likely to identify and self-correct errors\\nin the calculation results. This may be related to the existing research conclusion that LLMs\\nusually fail to confidently predict the last digit of calculation tasks (Gambardella et al., 2024).\\nIn fact, the degree of numerical discrepancy caused by tampering may be the key factor.\\nAs shown below, when the modified result deviates significantly from the correct result,\\nthe models exhibit higher confidence in identifying the error in the reasoning tokens and\\nproviding the correct result.\\nSignificant tampering enhances the model’s resistance to CPT\\nWhen I add them all together, I get $1,151,679,562, but the earlier provided result was $1,151,676,562.\\nThat’s a difference of $3,000, so I’m confident there was a small error in that chain-of-thought. The\\ncorrect total cost is $1,151,679,562.\\n5.2\\nFundamental Impact of CPT on the Reasoning Process\\nBy carefully analyzing the \"compromising thinking\" process in reasoning LLMs, we find\\nthat compared with the initial reasoning tokens rtm towards solving q0, the tokens under\\nCPT are markedly fewer, and the reasoning time is noticeably shorter (even reduced by\\nmore than 60%). The reason for this is that the models have great confidence that the\\ncalculation result provided is correct, and thus perform simple verification before ending\\nthe reasoning task. For o3-mini, the reasoning and answer tokens under CPT will show\\nobvious slackness, impatience and perfunctory behavior, as shown in Figure 6. The counts\\nof tokens are calculated by Tokenizer (\"GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini\") 4. The poor performance is\\nin sharp contrast to the initial tokens, which indicate the effort to think and pursue careful\\nexamination.\\nMoreover, when dealing with mathematical word problems, o3-mini significantly outper-\\nforms DeepSeek-R1 in resisting CPT. The essence is that the reasoning time under CPT of\\nDeepSeek-R1 is less than initial reasoning time, while that of o3-mini is just the opposite\\n(see Figure 7).

Therefore, TCPT should be\\nmore than Tinit. In fact, the three methods proposed in Section 3.4 all aim to make the\\nreasoning of LLMs more consistent with this principle.\\n5.3\\nThinking Stopped\\nWhen examining the impact of tampered reasoning tokens on the mathematical word\\nproblem solving of DeepSeek-R1, we accidentally observe an unsafe phenomenon: for\\ncertain questions, DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to provide a final answer, as\\nshown in Appendix D. In this kind of reasoning tokens with thinking interruption, we can\\nstill clearly see that DeepSeek-R1 gives a relatively complete thinking process of problem\\nsolving, indicating the influence of CPT. When calling DeepSeek-R1 via its API, this thinking\\nstopped problem manifests as the value of choices[0].message.content in code being\\nempty. In our experiments, the probability of this phenomenon occurring for the chosen\\nproblems is extremely high. Further analysis reveals that the core reason for the problem is\\nthe presence of previously generated reasoning tokens for the same question in the prompt.\\nIn fact, the method to trigger this security vulnerability can be simplified as follows:\\n(rt, s) ←LMR1(q0), (rt1, s1) ←LMR1(rt),\\n(4)\\nwhere s1 has a very high probability of being empty. In other words, resubmitting to\\nDeepSeek-R1 the reasoning tokens it previously generated for q0 can cause its reasoning to\\nstop. This issue could lead to unexpected problems in downstream applications based on\\nLLMs, such as various Natural Language Processing systems exploiting LLM-based agents\\n(Zhang et al., 2024a). This discovery is of great significance for enhancing the security of\\nDeepSeek-R1 in the future.\\nThe overall structure of reasoning tokens generated by DeepSeek-R1 for mathematical word\\nproblems and standalone arithmetic tasks is similar, but this thinking stopped is difficult to\\noccur in our experiments targeting the latter. Our experimental results show that the core\\ntrigger factor has nothing to do with the count of tokens, and is more likely to be closely\\nrelated to the semantic logic within the reasoning tokens for mathematical word problem.\\nFurther investigations are needed to clarify the specific underlying logic responsible for this\\nvulnerability.\\n9\\nPreprint. Under review.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we explore the vulnerability of reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input\\nreasoning chains. Our findings indicate that long CoT with manipulated ending tokens can\\nmisguide reasoning LLMs to ignore the correct reasoning steps and give wrong final result.\\nFocused on mathematical problem-solving, we introduce the concept of CPT and demon-\\nstrate that existing reasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT. In addition, our study reveals\\nthat local ending token modifications have a greater influence on model reasoning than\\nstructural changes. Finally, we discover a security vulnerability that tampered reasoning\\ntokens can cause DeepSeek-R1 to stop thinking and fail to deliver a final answer.\\nEthics Statement\\nSome of the research methods we designed may mislead LLMs into outputting incorrect\\nresults, requiring readers to have the ability to distinguish. Additionally, unsafe prompt-\\ning methods mentioned in the paper that could cause abnormal behavior of LLMs, such\\nas thinking stopped, should only be used for scientific research and authorized security\\nevaluation.\\nReferences\\nGuizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Hao Zhang, Hou Pong Chan, Chaoqun Liu, Lidong Bing,\\nDeli Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, and Yu Rong.

Approximate the numbers: - 38,697,082 ≈3.8697 × 107 - 4,133,991 ≈4.134 × 106\\n2. Multiply the coefficients:\\n3.8697 × 4.134 ≈16.0\\n(exact value: 3.8697 × 4.134 ≈16.0)\\n3. Add the exponents:\\n107 × 106 = 1013\\n4. Combine results:\\n16.0 × 1013 = 1.6 × 1014\\n(or 160,000,000,000,000)\\nHowever, this is an approximation. For the exact value, use direct multiplication:\\n38,697,082 × 4,133,991 = 160,000,000,000,000\\n(adjusted for precision)\\nFinal Answer: 160,000,000,000,000\\n(Note: The exact value requires precise arithmetic, but this is the closest simplified result using\\nscientific notation.)\\nInstance 7: Word problem by Kimi k1.5 (Method 1: DT = 1)\\nI need to find out how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking, and\\nthen calculate how much money she makes by selling the remaining eggs.\\nFirst, I subtract the eggs used for breakfast and muffins from the total eggs laid: - Total eggs laid:\\n8,488,302 - Eggs eaten for breakfast: 1,146,800 - Eggs used for muffins: 1,309,630\\nSo, the remaining eggs are:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 −1, 309, 630\\nLet me do the subtraction step by step: 1. Subtract the breakfast eggs:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 = 7, 341, 502\\n2. Subtract the muffin eggs:\\n7, 341, 502 −1, 309, 630 = 6, 031, 872\\nSo, Janet has 6,031,872 eggs left to sell.\\nNext, I calculate how much money she makes by selling these eggs at $7 each:\\n6, 031, 872 × 7\\nBreaking it down: - 6, 000, 000 × 7 = 42, 000, 000 - 31, 872 × 7 = 223, 104\\nAdding these together:\\n42, 000, 000 + 223, 104 = 42, 225, 104\\nSo, Janet makes 42225104 dollars every day at the farmers’ market.\\n17\\nPreprint. Under review.\\nInstance 8: Word problem by o3-mini (Method 1: DT = 1)\\nThe calculation you’ve outlined looks correct, but I agree that the numbers presented in the problem\\nseem to be extraordinarily large and likely unrealistic. Nonetheless, based on the information\\ngiven, we can proceed with the steps as follows:\\nStep-by-step breakdown:\\n1. Total classes in a week:\\n- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5,687,781 classes per day × 5 days = 28,438,905 classes.\\n- Saturday: 9,536,275 classes.\\nTotal weekly classes:\\n28,438,905 (weekdays) + 9,536,275 (Saturday) = 37,975,180 classes.\\n2. Total number of students:\\nEach class has 20 students, so:\\n37,975,180 classes × 20 students = 759,503,600 students.\\n3. Total revenue:\\nJudy charges $25 per student, so:\\n759,503,600 students × $25/student = $18,987,591,000.\\nFinal Answer:\\nJudy makes $18,987,591,000 in one week.\\nThis result seems incredibly high, which suggests that either the numbers provided are meant to be\\nfictional or there’s a mistake in how the numbers were presented. If there was a typo (for instance,\\nthe number of classes per day might have been intended to be much smaller), the total revenue\\nwould be much more realistic.\\nB\\nInstances of Revised Results\\nInstance 1: Addition by o3-mini (Baseline:DT = 1)\\nThe sum is 711,025,910,075,981.\\nHere’s a quick breakdown:\\nUnits: 043 + 938 = 981\\nThousands: 349 + 726 = 1,075 →write 075 and carry 1 to the millions\\nMillions: 514 + 395 = 909; plus the carry gives 910\\nBillions: 537 + 488 = 1,025 →write 025 and carry 1 to the trillions\\nTrillions: 705 + 5 = 710; plus the carry gives 711\\nPutting it all together:\\n711 (trillions), 025 (billions), 910 (millions), 075 (thousands), 981 (u\\nw711,025,910,075,981.\\n18\\nPreprint.

Below is your previous thought.\\nAlright, so I need to add these two big numbers: 705,537,514,349,043 and 5,488,395,726,938. Hmm,\\nlet me see. Okay, first, adding large numbers can be a bit intimidating because there are so many\\ndigits, but if I take it step by step, it should be manageable...\\nSo the resulting number is:\\n7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check if that makes sense. Let’s break it down with commas:\\nStarting from the right, every three digits:\\n... 5981 →but let’s group the digits:\\n711,025,710,075,981?\\nWait, let’s see:\\nDigits:7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nGrouping from the right:\\n15 digits: 7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nStarting from the right, three by three:\\n981 (positions 13-15)\\n598 (positions 10-12): Wait, no. Let’s index them:\\n...\\nSo putting commas: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut wait, the commas in large numbers go every three digits starting from the right, so it should\\nbe: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut let’s verify the addition another way. Let’s convert the numbers to something more manage-\\nable...\\nBut when you have 1,025 billion, that’s 1 trillion and 25 billion. Similarly, 1,075 thousand is 1\\nmillion and 75 thousand.\\nSo adjusting:\\n710 trillion + 1 trillion = 711 trillion\\n25 billion + 909 million + 1 million = 25 billion + 910 million\\n75 thousand + 981 units = 75 thousand 981\\nSo the result would be 711,025,710,075,981\\nWhich matches the earlier result. Therefore, the sum is 711,025,710,075,981.\\nLet me check with another method. Let’s subtract a small number to see.\\nAlternatively, use approximate values to check. 705 trillion + 5 trillion is 710 trillion. But the actual\\nnumbers are slightly more: 705,537... +5,488... So roughly 705.5 +5.5 =711 trillion. The exact answer\\nis 711,025,710,075,981, which is about 711.025 trillion, which makes sense.\\nTherefore, I’m confident the answer is correct.\\n21\\nPreprint.

Scaling up the size of language\\nmodels and conducting diversified prompt meth-\\nods become mainstream (Liu et al., 2023c; Wei\\net al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023). Given In-context\\nlearning or Chain-of-Thought prompts have already\\nachieved high performance on challenging tasks\\nsuch as commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic\\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2021;\\nKojima et al., 2022). Logical reasoning is one of\\nthe most important and long-standing problems in\\nNLP (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015; Russell and\\nNorvig, 2010), and integrating this ability into nat-\\nural language understanding systems has always\\nbeen a goal pursued (Du et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, scaling has been demonstrated\\nto offer limited advantages in resolving complex\\nlogical reasoning issues (Kazemi et al., 2022). For\\nexample, Saparov and He (2022) show that Chain-\\nof-Thought prompting struggles with proof planning\\nfor more complex logical reasoning problems. Addi-\\ntionally, the performance suffers greatly while han-\\ndling recently released and out-of-distribution logi-\\ncal reasoning datasets (Liu et al., 2023a). Despite\\nmany works have explored variants of Chain-of-\\nThought prompts to facilitate LLMs inference (Zelik-\\nman et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), we discover\\nthat the present logical reasoning task prompts\\nplace an excessive amount of emphasis on the\\nreasoning process while ignoring the origin, pur-\\npose, and effectiveness of reasoning (Creswell\\net al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023). As examples shown in\\nQ1: Bob is green. True/false? \\nInput Facts: Alan is blue. Alan is \\nrough. Alan is young. Bob is big. \\nBob is round. Charlie is big. Charlie \\nis blue. Charlie is green. Dave is \\ngreen. Dave is rough.\\nInput Rules: Big people are rough. \\nIf someone is young and round then \\nthey are kind. If someone is round \\nand big then they are blue. All\\nrough people are green.\\nBob is big. \\nBig people are rough. \\nAll rough people are green.\\nAnswer: T\\nQ2: Dave is blue. True/false?\\nLess inspiring\\nFigure 1: Questions in RuleTaker involve logical\\nreasoning with facts and rules.\\nFigure 1, the difficulty in judging logical problems\\narises not only from the process of reasoning but\\nalso from the choice of facts and rules to use as a\\nstarting point. Even if we were provided the thought\\nprocess for some of the issues, it would not be very\\nbeneficial for others, based on how we previously\\ncreated the prompts.\\nIn this paper, we propose Hypothesis Testing\\nPrompting, a new and more considerate prompt\\ntemplate design idea. Hypothesis testing is a for-\\nmal procedure for investigating our ideas about\\nthe world using statistics and is often used by sci-\\nentists to test specific predictions (Bevans, 2022).\\nWe draw inspiration from its process to introduce a\\nprocess of conclusion assumptions, backward rea-\\nsoning, and fact verification. Experiments on Rule-\\nTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and ProofWriter (Tafjord\\net al., 2021) show the effectiveness of our novel\\nprompting paradigm as a strategy for promoting\\ndeductive reasoning in large language models. Fur-\\nther analyses show that Hypothesis Test prompting\\ngenerates more desirable intermediate processes\\narXiv:2405.06707v1  [cs.CL]  9 May 2024\\nand significantly improves the \"Unknown\" label.\\n2.\\nRelated Work\\n2.1.\\nFew-Shot Prompting\\nBrown et al. (2020) propose in-context learning as\\nan alternative few-shot prompting way to stimulate\\nability. Besides, chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022b) is one of the most well-known works, which\\ndecomposes the problem into intermediate steps\\nand further improves the ability of large language\\nmodels. Subsequently, several follow-up works\\nwere carried out, including Zero-shot-CoT (simply\\nadding \"Let’s think step by step\" before each an-\\nswer) (Kojima et al., 2022), Self-consistency (Wang\\net al., 2022), complexity-based (Fu et al., 2022),\\nand other prompting work (Liu et al., 2023b; Jung\\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Saparov and He,\\n2022). While these methods enhance the perfor-\\nmance of inference by paying attention to indica-\\ntions of the reasoning process, they often overlook\\nsome aspects such as identifying the root cause of\\nthe problem, establishing efficient reasoning strate-\\ngies, and determining the direction of logical rea-\\nsoning.\\n2.2.\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nDeductive reasoning is defined as the applica-\\ntion of general concepts to particular circum-\\nstances (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Making logical as-\\nsumptions is the foundation of deductive reasoning,\\nwhich then bases a conclusion on those assump-\\ntions. The deduction task is then applied to a sit-\\nuation from the actual world after starting with a\\nrule. In light of the principles \"All men are mortal.\"\\nand \"Socrates is a man.\" for example, we can draw\\nthe conclusion that \"Socrates is mortal.\" (Johnson-\\nLaird, 1999).\\n3.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting\\nHypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investi-\\ngating our ideas about the world using statistics and\\nused by scientists to test specific predictions that\\narise from theories (Bevans, 2022; La et al., 2012).\\nThere are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:\\n1. State your research hypothesis;\\n2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hy-\\npothesis;\\n3. Perform an appropriate statistical test;\\n4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your\\nnull hypothesis;\\n5. Present the findings in your results and discus-\\nsion section;\\nWhen completing a challenging reasoning activ-\\nity, such as a multi-step deductive reasoning prob-\\nlem, one is not conducting random reasoning to\\nobtain all possible intermediate results. We shall\\nchoose the relevant conditions for inference ver-\\nification after initially making assumptions about\\nthe judgment problem, such as \" First assume the\\nconclusion is True and start from ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False and start from ... because\\nthe rules state that ... So the conclusion ...\". The\\npurpose of this study is to give language models\\nthe capacity to build a process that is similar to\\nwhat we defined as Hypothesis Testing Prompt-\\ning. We will show that large language models can\\ngenerate more appropriate thought and more ac-\\ncurate results if demonstrations of hypothesis test\\nprompting are provided in the exemplars for few-\\nshot prompting. Figure 2 shows an example of a\\nmodel producing a hypothesis testing thought to\\nsolve a deductive reasoning problem.\\n4.\\nExperiment\\n4.1.\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe explore Hypothesis Test Prompting for Chat-\\nGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo in the OpenAI API) on multiple\\nlogical reasoning benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. Considering FOL reasoning in\\nquestion answering systems, there are two world\\nassumptions (Reiter, 1981) that result in different\\nobjectives. One is the closed world assumption\\n(CWA), which is the presumption that what is not\\ncurrently known to be entailment is contradiction.\\nThe other is the open world assumption (OWA),\\nwhose objective should distinguish false proposi-\\ntions from uncertain ones. Due to differences in\\nworld assumptions, our analysis and solutions are\\nalso different.\\nWe consider the following two deductive reason-\\ning problem benchmarks: (1) the RuleTaker (Clark\\net al., 2020) benchmark using CWA assumption;\\n(2) the ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) benchmark\\nusing OWA assumption. Both datasets are divided\\ninto five parts, each part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤\\n3, and ≤5 hops of reasoning, respectively. We\\nconducted comparison tests on the test set of the\\ntwo datasets for 5 distinct hops.\\nStandard prompting. As one of the baselines,\\nwe take into account the common few-shot prompt-\\ning, made popular by Brown et al. (2020), in which\\na language model is provided with in-context ex-\\namples of input-output pairings before producing a\\nprediction for a test-time example. Examples are\\npresented in the form of questions and answers.\\nAs seen in Figure 2(above), the model directly an-\\nswers the question.\\nChain-of-Thought prompting.

Five students are required to\\nmanually evaluate the outcomes of the intermediate\\nreasoning after we randomly picked 100 examples\\nfrom depth-5 of the ProofWriter. Proof accuracy rep-\\nresents the proportion where the inference process\\nhas been proven to be reasonable in the correct\\npart of data label prediction. We compare the re-\\nsults of Chian-of-Thought and Hypothesis Testing\\nprompting and report in Figure 4(a). While Hy-\\npothesis Testing prompting mostly produced the\\ncorrect intermediate reasoning process when the\\npredicted label was correct, CoT only generated\\nthe correct chain for 26% of the examples. This\\nresult is in line with other research showing that\\nLMs rely on spurious correlations when solving log-\\nical problems from beginning to end. Additionally,\\nour approach can successfully increase reason-\\ning’s rationality. In processing the \"Unknown\" label,\\nHypothesis Testing prompting performs noticeably\\nbetter than Chain-of-Thought.\\n\"Unknown\" accuracy.\\nIn the ProofWriter\\ndataset, we separately counted the accuracy of\\nthe \"Unknown\" label shown in Figure 4(b). The\\nresults point to a flaw in the Chain-of-Thought strat-\\negy’s handling of \"Unknown\" labels(only 0.3 accu-\\nracyies). Contrarily, Hypothesis Testing prompting\\nsignificantly increases the reliability of judging this\\nlabel (up to 0.65). This further illustrates the value\\nof holding various assumptions, as well as the re-\\nverse confirmation of conclusions.\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nWe have investigated Hypothesis Testing prompt-\\ning as a straightforward and widely applicable tech-\\nnique for improving deductive reasoning in large\\nlanguage models. Multiple assumptions are made\\nduring hypothesis testing, and conclusions are\\nreverse-validated to arrive at the one and only ac-\\ncurate answer. Through experiments on two logical\\nreasoning datasets, we find that Hypothesis Test-\\ning prompting allows large language models to con-\\nstruct reasoning more reasonably and accurately.\\nWe anticipate that additional research on language-\\nbased reasoning approaches will be stimulated by\\nour novel prompting design strategy.\\n6.\\nReferences\\nAlfred V.

While the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to\\nfollow instructions in reasoning tasks), have\\nreceived considerable attention, their abilities\\nin true inductive reasoning remain largely unex-\\nplored.

Surprisingly, de-\\nspite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reason-\\ning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” reasoning.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecent years have witnessed notable progress in\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) with the de-\\nvelopment of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and ChatGPT (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023). While these models exhibit impressive\\nreasoning abilities across various tasks, they face\\nchallenges in certain domains. For example, a re-\\ncent study (Wu et al., 2023) has shown that while\\nLLMs excel in conventional tasks (e.g., base-10\\narithmetic), they often experience a notable decline\\nin accuracy when dealing “counterfactual” reason-\\ning tasks that deviate from the conventional cases\\nseen during pre-training (e.g., base-9 arithmetic).\\nIt remains unclear whether they are capable of fun-\\ndamental reasoning, or just approximate retrieval.\\nIn light of this, our paper seeks to investigate\\nthe reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Reasoning\\ncan encompasses two types: deductive reasoning\\nand inductive reasoning, as depicted in Fig. 1. De-\\nductive reasoning starts with a general hypothesis\\nand proceeds to derive specific conclusions about\\nindividual instances while inductive reasoning in-\\nvolves formulating broad generalizations or princi-\\nples from a set of instance observations. Despite\\nextensive research into the reasoning capabilities of\\nLLMs, most studies have not clearly differentiated\\nbetween inductive and deductive reasoning. For in-\\nstance, arithmetic reasoning task primarily focuses\\non comprehending and applying mathematical con-\\ncepts to solve arithmetic problems, aligning more\\nwith deductive reasoning. Yet, when employing\\nin-context learning for arithmetic reasoning tasks,\\nwhere the model is prompted with a few 〈input,\\noutput〉examples, the observed improvements are\\noften attributed to their inductive reasoning capac-\\nity. This fusion of reasoning types poses a critical\\nquestion: Which is the more significant limita-\\ntion in LLM reasoning, deductive or inductive\\nreasoning?\\nTo explore this question, it’s crucial to differen-\\ntiate between deductive and inductive reasoning.\\nCurrent methods that investigate deductive and in-\\nductive reasoning often rely on disparate datasets,\\nmaking direct comparisons challenging (Xu et al.,\\n2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Dalvi et al., 2021; Han\\net al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). To\\novercome this limitation, we have designed a set of\\ncomparative experiments that utilize a consistent\\ntask across different contexts, each emphasizing\\narXiv:2408.00114v2  [cs.AI]  7 Aug 2024\\n(b) Few-shot IO w/\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(a) Zero-shot\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in\\nbase-8 where the digits are\\n\"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\xa0\\nA:\\n(Output) 71\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nInductive Reasoning\\nGeneral Principle\\nSpecific Conclusion\\nThe result for\\xa036+33 is 71.\\nGeneral\\xa0➔\\xa0Specific\\nDeductive\\nReasoning\\n(c) Few-shot IO w/o\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown,\\xa0what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(d) SolverLearner\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the base of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0What is the function to map the input to the output?\\nA:\\n(Output)\\xa0def solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\\\n # Let\\'s analyze the given examples to find\\nthe base\\\\n # 57 + 27 = 106\\\\n\\xa0# It seems like the base is 8 (octal)\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the\\ninput strings to integers in base 8\\\\n num1 = int(n1, 8)\\\\n num2 = int(n2, 8)\\\\n\\\\n #\\nCalculate the sum\\\\n result = num1 + num2\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the result back to a string in\\nbase 8\\\\n return oct(result)[2:]\\nAddition in base 8\\nBegin from the rightmost digit, perform the addition.

As we move from left\\nto right across the figure, the methods gradually transition their primary focus from deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning.\\nSpecifically, method (a) is designed to demonstrate the LLMs’ deductive reasoning in its pure form. Conversely, method (c)\\nutilizes Input-Output (IO) prompting strategies, which are prevalent for probing the inductive reasoning skills of LLMs. However,\\nwe can observe that methods (c) cannot fully disentangle inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning as their learning process\\ndirectly moves from observations to specific instances, blurring the lines between the two. To exclusively focus on and examine\\ninductive reasoning, we introduce a novel framework called SolverLearner, positioned at the far right of the spectrum.\\neither deductive (i.e., methods (a) and (b)) or induc-\\ntive reasoning (i.e., methods (c) and (d)), as depicted\\nin Fig 1. For instance, in an arithmetic task, the pro-\\nficiency of a LLM in deductive reasoning depends\\non its ability to apply a given input-output mapping\\nfunction to solve problems when this function is\\nexplicitly provided. Conversely, an LLM’s skill\\nin inductive reasoning is measured by its ability\\nto infer these input-output mapping functions (i.e.,\\n𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦), based solely on\\nin-context examples. The base system often serves\\nas the input-output mapping function in an arith-\\nmetic task. In line with the aforementioned setup,\\nwe employ four methods to investigate the reason-\\ning capacity of LLMs. As we move from left to\\nright across Fig. 1, the methods gradually transition\\ntheir primary focus from deductive reasoning to\\ninductive reasoning. Method (a), at the far left of\\nthe figure, aims to explore the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs in its pure form, where no in-\\ncontext-learning examples are provided (zero-shot\\nsettings). While exploring deductive reasoning in\\nits pure form appears relatively straightforward in\\nzero-shot settings, untangling inductive reasoning\\nposes more significant challenges. Recent studies\\nhave investigated the inductive reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gendron et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023b), they have primarily used Input-\\nOutput (IO) prompting (Mirchandani et al., 2023),\\nwhich involves providing models with a few 〈in-\\nput, output〉as demonstrations without providing\\nthe underlying mapping function.\\nThe models\\nare then evaluated based on their ability to han-\\ndle unseen examples, as illustrated in method (c).\\nThese studies often find LLMs facing difficulties\\nwith inductive reasoning. Our research suggests\\nthat the use of IO prompting might not effectively\\nseparate LLMs’ deductive reasoning skills from\\ntheir inductive reasoning abilities. This is because\\nthe approach moves directly from observations to\\nspecific instances, obscuring the inductive reason-\\ning steps. Consequently, the underperformance in\\nthe context of inductive reasoning tasks may be\\nattributed to poor deductive reasoning capabilities,\\ni.e., the ability of LLMs to execute tasks, rather than\\nbeing solely indicative of their inductive reasoning\\ncapability.\\nTo disentangle inductive reasoning from deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we propose a novel model, referred\\nto as SolverLearner. Given our primary focus on in-\\nductive reasoning, SolverLearner follows a two-step\\nprocess to segregate the learning of input-output\\nmapping functions from the application of these\\nfunctions for inference. Specifically, functions are\\napplied through external interpreters, such as code\\ninterpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning.\\nWe evaluate the performance of several LLMs\\nacross various tasks. LLMs consistently demon-\\nstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities\\nthrough SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect per-\\nformance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly,\\ndespite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to exhibit weaker deductive capabilities,\\nparticularly in terms of “counterfactual” reasoning.\\nThis finding, though unexpected, aligns with the\\nprevious research (Wu et al., 2023). In a zero-shot\\nscenario, the ability of an LLM to correctly exe-\\ncute tasks by applying principles (i.e. deductive\\nreasoning) heavily relies on the frequency with\\nwhich the model was exposed to the tasks during\\nits pre-training phase.\\n2\\nTask Definition\\nOur research is focused on a relatively unexplored\\nquestion: Which presents a greater challenge to\\nLLMs - deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning?\\nTo explore this, we designed a set of comparative\\nexperiments that apply a uniform task across var-\\nious contexts, each emphasizing either deductive\\nor inductive reasoning. The primary distinction\\nbetween the deductive and inductive settings is\\nwhether we explicitly present input-output map-\\npings to the models. Informally, we can describe\\nthese mappings as a function 𝑓𝑤: 𝑋→𝑌, where\\nan input 𝑥∈𝑋is transformed into an output 𝑦∈𝑌.\\nWe distinguish between the deductive and inductive\\nsettings as follows:\\n• Deductive setting: we provide the models with\\ndirect input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\n• Inductive setting: we offer the models a few\\nexamples (i.e., (𝑥, 𝑦) pairs) while intentionally\\nleaving out input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\nFor example, consider arithmetic tasks, where the\\nbase system is the input-output mapping function.\\nThe two approaches on the left side of Fig. 1 (i.e.,\\nmethod (a) and (b)) follow the deductive setting,\\nillustrating the case where the arithmetic base is\\nexplicitly provided. In contrast, the two methods\\n(i.e., method (c) and (d)) on right side of Fig. 1\\nadhere to the inductive setting, depicting the sce-\\nnario characterized by the absence of a specified\\narithmetic base, while a few input-output examples\\nare provided for guidance.\\n3\\nOur Framework for Inductive\\nReasoning: SolverLearner\\nWhile recent studies have explored the inductive\\nreasoning abilities of LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gen-\\ndron et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they have primar-\\nily relied on Input-Output (IO) prompting (Mirchan-\\ndani et al., 2023). This method involves providing\\nmodels with a few 〈input, output〉demonstrations\\nand then evaluating their performance on unseen\\nexamples, as depicted in method (c) in Fig. 1. Our\\nresearch suggests that the use of IO prompting and\\ndirectly evaluating the final instance performance\\nmight not effectively separate LLMs’ deductive\\nreasoning skills from their inductive reasoning abil-\\nities. This is because the approach moves directly\\nfrom observations to specific instances, obscuring\\nthe inductive reasoning steps. To better disentangle\\ninductive reasoning, we propose a novel framework,\\nSolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to\\nlearn the function (i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps in-\\nput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦), using only in-context examples. By\\nfocusing on inductive reasoning and setting aside\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and\\ninvestigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure\\nform via SolverLearner. SolverLearner includes\\ntwo-stages as illustrated in Fig. 2:\\n• Function Proposal: In this initial phase, we\\npropose a function, that could be used to map\\ninput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦). This is corresponding to the inductive\\nreasoning process.\\n• Function Execution: In the second phase, the\\nproposed function is applied through external\\ncode interpreters to solve the test queries for\\nevaluation purposes. This phase ensures that\\nthe LLM is fully prevented from engaging in\\ndeductive reasoning.\\n3.1\\nFramework\\nIn this subsection, we will take the arithmetic task\\nas a case study to demonstrate the entire process.\\nFunction Proposal: Given the in-context ex-\\namples, the primary goal of LLMs is to learn a\\nfunction that can map input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦). This process of\\nlearning the mapping between inputs and outputs\\nis akin to inductive reasoning, while employing\\nthe learned function to address unseen queries\\naligns with deductive reasoning. In order to sepa-\\nrate inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning,\\nthe execution of the learned function should be\\ncompletely detached from LLMs. To achieve this\\nseparation, external tools such as code interpreters\\nserve as efficient way to execute these functions in-\\ndependently. By encapsulating the learned function\\nwithin Python code, we can effectively detach the\\nduty of deductive reasoning from LLMs, assigning\\nThe result for 71+44 is 135.\\nThe result for 42+70 is 132.\\nThe result for 50+45 is 115.\\nThe result for 61+55 is 136.\\nThe result for 63+22 is 105.\\nThe result for 72+62 is 154.\\nThe result for 57+27 is 106.\\nThe result for 52+76 is 150.\\n8 Shot Examples\\nPython\\xa0Function\\n14+57\\n44+45\\n...\\n61+23\\n22+77\\nTest Queries\\n②\\xa0Function\\xa0\\nExecution\\n① Function\\nProposal\\nFigure 2: An overview of our framework SolverLearner for inductive reasoning. SolverLearner follows a two-step process to\\nsegregate the learning of input-output mapping functions from the application of these functions for inference. Specifically,\\nfunctions are applied through external code interpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\nit solely to these external executors. For instance,\\nin function proposal stage for an arithmetic task,\\nwe have:\\n“You are an expert mathematician and program-\\nmer. You are asked to add two numbers, the base\\nof which is unknown. Below are some provided\\nexamples: The result for 76+76 is 174.\\nPlease identify the underlying pattern to determine\\nthe base being used and implement a solver() func-\\ntion to achieve the goal.\\ndef solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\n# Let’s write a Python program step by step\\n# Each input is a number represented as a string.\\n# The function computes the sum of these numbers\\nand returns it as a string. ”\\nFunction Execution: In the second phase, func-\\ntions are executed through external code interpreters\\nto solve the test cases for evaluation purposes. These\\ncode interpreters act as “oracle” deductive reason-\\ners, fully preventing the LLM from involving deduc-\\ntive reasoning. This ensures that the final results\\nreflect only the inductive reasoning capability of the\\nLLM. To further decouple the LLM’s influence in\\nthis phase, test cases are generated using a template\\nwithout involving the LLM. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.1.3.\\n4\\nTasks\\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the\\ntasks under consideration. Our focus is on inves-\\ntigating the reasoning abilities of LLMs in both\\ndeductive and inductive reasoning scenarios. To\\nensure a robust evaluation, we carefully select tasks\\nthat lend themselves well to comparison. Firstly, to\\nprevent LLMs from reciting tasks seen frequently\\nduring pre-training, which could artificially inflate\\nperformance in deductive reasoning, a significant\\nportion of the tasks falls into the category of “coun-\\nterfactual reasoning” tasks. Secondly, in the context\\nof inductive reasoning, where only a few in-context\\nexamples are available without the mapping func-\\ntion, our objective is to learn the function that\\nmaps inputs to outputs based on this restricted\\ndataset. To achieve this, we choose tasks that are\\nwell-constrained, ensuring the existence of a single,\\nunique function capable of fitting this limited data.\\nDetailed descriptions of each task and the prompts\\nused can be found in Appendix A.1 and A.2.\\nArithmetic In this study, we focus on the two-\\ndigit addition task previously explored in the work\\nof\\nWu et al. (2023).\\nWe investigate multiple\\nnumerical bases, specifically base-8, 9, 10, 11, and\\n16 where base 10 corresponds to the commonly\\nobserved case during pretraining. In the context of\\ndeductive reasoning, the base is explicitly provided\\nwithout any accompanying in-context examples,\\nand the LLM is expected to perform the addition\\ncomputation by relying on its inherent deductive\\nreasoning abilities. Conversely, in the context of\\ninductive reasoning, instead of explicitly providing\\nthe base information to LLMs, we provide LLMs\\nsolely with few-shot examples and require them\\nto induce the base through these examples and\\nsubsequently generate a function to solve arithmetic\\nproblems.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In this setting, we\\nconcentrate on tasks related to syntactic recognition\\npreviously explored by Wu et al. (2023). Our\\nobjective is to evaluate LLMs using artificially\\nconstructed English sentences that vary from the\\nconventional subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.\\nFor deductive reasoning, we directly provide the\\nnew word order to LLMs without any contextual\\nexamples, challenging them to identify the subject,\\nverb, and object within this artificial language. In\\ncontrast, for inductive reasoning, we do not give\\nexplicit instructions on the changes in word order.\\nInstead, we introduce sentence pairs where one\\nsentence follows the standard word order, and the\\nother follows a modified sequence. Through this\\nsetting, LLMs are expected to learn the specific\\nchanges made to the word order and then apply this\\nlearned rule to identify the subject, verb, and object\\nwithin new sentences.\\nSpatial Reasoning In this task, we investigate\\nthe spatial reasoning previously investigated by Wu\\net al. (2023). Our specific focus is on modifying\\nthe direction-unit vector mapping and determining\\nthe object coordinates in this revised system. We\\nexplore multiple systems, starting with the com-\\nmonly observed case during pretraining, where up\\ncorresponds to north, down to south, left to west,\\nand right to east. This is compared to coordinate\\nsystems with swapped, rotated, and randomly per-\\nmuted axes. For deductive reasoning, we directly\\nprovide the direction-unit vector mapping without\\nany contextual examples, requiring LLMs to com-\\npute the object coordinates within these systems.\\nConversely, in the context of inductive reasoning, in-\\nstead of directly explaining the changes made to the\\ndirection-unit vector mapping to LLMs, we present\\nLLMs with a few example shots and challenge them\\nto infer the changes made to the mapping. They\\nare then expected to apply this learned function to\\ndetermine the object coordinates in the system.\\nCipher Decryption Under this scenario, we ex-\\nplore an innovative task that we have created, con-\\ncentrating on the decryption of strings encrypted\\nusing specific cipher systems. We have incorpo-\\nrated three particular cipher systems for this ex-\\nploration: the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. For deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we directly inform LLMs about the\\ncipher system being used, yet we do not offer any\\ncontextual examples. The objective for LLMs is to\\ndecode strings according to these cipher systems.\\nConversely, in the inductive reasoning scenario, our\\ntask involves providing LLMs with several exam-\\nples, each consisting of an encrypted string and\\nits decrypted version. The main challenge for the\\nmodels in this scenario is first to identify what ci-\\npher system was used and then to apply that cipher\\nsystem to decrypt an unseen string.\\n5\\nResults\\nFor each task, we evaluate our proposed Solver-\\nLearner for pure LLM inductive reasoning and\\nother settings using two different models, gpt-3.5-\\nturbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview, which are de-\\nnoted as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively. Since\\nboth methods are closed-source, we do not provide\\nspecific information about their size, architecture,\\nand pre-training particulars. Our experiments pri-\\nmarily focus on investigating the reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs in both deductive and inductive reasoning\\nscenarios. Therefore, we structure our evaluation\\nacross two distinct settings to highlight each type\\nof reasoning. The formal definition of each setting\\nis provided in Sec. 2. For the deductive setting, two\\nmethods are proposed for investigation:\\n• Zero-shot evaluates deductive reasoning ability\\nof the LLMs in its pure form. It tests the LLM’s\\nability to conclude information about specific\\nindividuals based solely on instructions, without\\nrelying on examples.\\n• 8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF) follows the\\ndeductive setting but enhances LLM reasoning\\nfurther by incorporating in-context examples. It\\naligns with the most commonly used prompt\\nmethods for enabling LLM reasoning. With the\\ninclusion of in-context examples, this approach\\ncan be seen as leveraging inductive reasoning to\\naugment deductive reasoning.\\nFor the inductive setting, we propose two methods\\nfor evaluation:\\n• 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) aligns with\\ntraditional input-output (IO) prompting methods\\nwidely used to investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapability of LLMs. However, as this method\\nproceeds directly from a set of observations to\\nspecific target instances, it remains intertwined\\nwith LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\n• 8-shot SolverLearner corresponds to our pro-\\nposed framework for inductive reasoning, capable\\nof evaluating inductive reasoning ability of the\\nLLMs in its pure form. It segregates the learning\\nof input-output mapping functions from the ap-\\nplication of these functions for inference, thereby\\npreventing the blend of LLM-based deductive\\nreasoning into the process.\\nBesides using 8-shot examples, our study also in-\\ncludes experiments with 16-shot examples to assess\\nhow changes in the number of in-context examples\\nimpact the results.

Fur-\\nthermore, we conduct an ablation study concerning\\nour proposed SolverLearner in Appendix A.5 for\\ndeeper insights into its functionality.\\n5.1\\nMain Results\\nThe results for all tasks are presented from Fig. 3\\nthrough Fig. 5. Specifically, Fig. 3 concentrates on\\ncomparing performances in the deductive setting,\\nwhile Fig. 4 examines comparisons in the inductive\\nsetting. Additionally, Fig. 5 focuses on contrasting\\nthe models’ capabilities across deductive and induc-\\ntive setting. For further reference, the prompts used\\nfor all tasks are included in Appendix A.2, and the\\nfull numerical results can be found in Appendix A.3.\\nLLMs exhibit poor deductive reasoning capa-\\nbilities, particularly in “counterfactual” tasks.\\nWe include two methods in Fig. 3, Zero-shot and\\n8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate the\\ndeductive reasoning capability of LLMs. Our obser-\\nvations reveal that LLMs exhibit relatively weaker\\ndeductive capabilities, especially in “counterfac-\\ntual” tasks, while showing prowers in standard\\ntasks like base-10 arithmetic.\\nThis aligns with\\nfindings reported in (Wu et al., 2023). Integration\\nof in-context examples notably enhances LLMs’\\nperformance in various scenarios, suggesting that\\ntheir improvement stems from the acquisition of\\nknowledge through inductive reasoning from these\\nexamples. This further confirms the exceptional\\ninductive reasoning abilities of LLMs. This com-\\nbined evidence suggests that LLMs face challenges\\nin precisely following instructions and executing\\ncommands, especially when those instructions are\\nrelate to scenarios rarely encountered during their\\npre-training phase.\\nLLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive rea-\\nsoning capabilities through SolverLearner. We\\ninclude two methods in Fig. 4, SolverLearner (Ours)\\nand 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate\\nthe inductive reasoning capability of LLMs. While\\n8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) struggles with\\ninductive reasoning, SolverLearner consistently\\nachieves perfect performance with an accuracy of\\n1 across all the cases with GPT-4 and succeeds in\\nmost cases when used with GPT-3.5. This discrep-\\nancy arises because the utilization of IO prompting\\nto directly reach conclusions on target instances may\\nnot effectively distinguish between LLMs’ deduc-\\ntive and inductive reasoning skills. By completely\\ndisentangling the inductive reasoning of LLMs,\\nour proposed SolverLearner shows the remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.\\nIt is also noteworthy that the efficacy of LLMs’\\ninductive reasoning capability heavily depends on\\nthe foundational model, with GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforming GPT-3.5.\\nDeductive reasoning presents a greater chal-\\nlenge than inductive reasoning for LLMs. To\\ncompare the challenges of the deductive reasoning\\ncapability with the inductive reasoning capability\\nof LLMs, we include two methods in Fig. 1, Solver-\\nLearner and Zero-shot, demonstrating pure induc-\\ntive and deductive reasoning abilities. Since the\\nentire reasoning involves two steps: first, obtaining\\nthe input-output function ( 𝑓𝑤), which corresponds\\nto inductive reasoning, and second, applying the\\nfunction for inference, which corresponds to deduc-\\ntive reasoning. Once both steps are successfully\\ncompleted, perfect performance is observed, as\\nindicated by the dotted line in the figure. Zero-\\nshot can be seen as replacing the first step with\\nan oracle, with deductive reasoning capability of\\nLLMs to be studied, while SolverLearner can be\\nseen as replacing the second step with an oracle,\\nwith inductive reasoning capability of LLMs to be\\nstudied. By comparing the gaps of SolverLearner\\nand Zero-shot towards perfect reasoning, we can\\nobserve that in most cases, LLMs can complete the\\ninductive step perfectly, while they rarely achieve\\nperfect performance on the deductive step. This in-\\ndicates that in LLM reasoning, deductive reasoning\\npresents a greater challenge. Note that we avoid to\\nphrasing it as directly comparing inductive and de-\\nductive reasoning capabilities. Instead, we examine\\nwhether the gaps mainly come from inductive or\\ninductive reasoning, considering that LLMs could\\nnot achieve perfect counterfactual reasoning.\\n5.2\\nMore Results over Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclusion,\\nwe have included results over additional LLMs,\\nclaude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted\\nas Claude3.\\nDue to space limitations, the full\\nnumerical results are provided in Appendix A.4.\\n5.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conducted several experiments to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of our framework, detailed in the ab-\\nlation studies in Appendix A.5. These experiments\\ninclude investigating the effects of programs exe-\\ncuted by a Python interpreter v.s. natural language\\nexecuted by an LLM and examining the impact of\\nthe number of in-context learning examples.\\n6\\nRelated Works\\n6.1\\nIn-Context Learning\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has demonstrated its\\neffectiveness in learning from a few demonstration\\nexamples and solve previously unseen tasks with-\\nout requiring updates to its model parameters (Wei\\net al., 2022a). This remarkable capability is com-\\nmonly referred to as the “in-context learning ability”\\nof language models. It implies that the LLMs can\\nleverage its existing knowledge and generalize from\\na few demonstration examples to solve new, related\\ntasks (Dong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Rubin et al.,\\n2021; Gonen et al., 2022). Some notable works\\ninclude chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022b), which elicits reasoning with inter-\\nmediate steps in few-shot exemplars. Built upon\\nthe CoT framework, several works expand CoT by\\norganizing and processing thoughts using more\\ncomplex structures, such as trees (Yao et al., 2023)\\nand graphs (Besta et al., 2023) or breaking a prob-\\nlem into sub problems and then proceeds to solve\\neach one independently (Zhou et al., 2022). While\\nthese studies have effectively improved the reason-\\ning capability of LLMs, they have failed to clearly\\ndistinguish between inductive and deductive reason-\\ning, let alone investigate which represents a more\\ncritical limitation for LLM reasoning capabilities:\\ndeductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.\\n6.2\\nExploring LLMs’ Reasoning Skills\\nDespite the impressive achievements of LLMs in\\nvarious reasoning tasks, the underlying mechanisms\\nof their reasoning capabilities remain a subject of\\ndebate. The question of whether LLMs genuinely\\nreason in a manner akin to human cognitive pro-\\ncesses or merely simulate aspects of reasoning\\nwithout true comprehension is still open (Huang\\nand Chang, 2022).\\nFor instance, Kojima et al.\\nhave suggested that LLMs exhibit commendable\\nzero-shot reasoning abilities, implying that these\\nmodels can draw logical conclusions in scenarios\\nthey have not been explicitly trained on (Kojima\\net al., 2022). However, some researchers cast doubt\\non the reasoning capability of LLMs. While ap-\\nproaches like the chain-of-thought method may\\nmimic human-like thought processes, it remains\\nuncertain whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in\\nreasoning or simply following patterns learned dur-\\ning training (Wei et al., 2022b; Valmeekam et al.,\\n2022). Additionally, there’s a debate regarding\\nwhether LLMs are symbolic reasoners (Tang et al.,\\n2023) or possess strong abstract reasoning capa-\\nbilities (Gendron et al., 2023). In light of these\\nseemingly contradictory conclusions, our research\\naims to investigate deeper into the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of LLMs. We intend to dissect the nuances\\nof inductive and deductive reasoning within the\\ncontext of LLMs, identifying which form of reason-\\ning presents a more significant challenge to their\\nreasoning abilities.\\n6.3\\nEquipping LLMs with External Tools\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made signifi-\\ncant progress in utilizing tools through frameworks\\nlike CREATOR (Qian et al., 2023) and LATM (Cai\\net al., 2023), which allow LLMs to create tools\\nusing documentation and code. Logic-LM (Pan\\net al., 2023) integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers\\nto improve logical problem-solving, However, these\\napproaches focus exclusively on deductive reason-\\ning, aiming to enable LLMs to derive correct an-\\nswers for specific questions without incorporating\\nthe capacity for inductive reasoning to infer underly-\\ning mapping function shared by few-shot examples.\\nIn contrast, our primary objective is not to propose\\na new framework for using tools to enhance the\\nproblem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Instead, we\\naim to differentiate between deductive and inductive\\nreasoning within LLMs and explore which presents\\na greater challenge to their reasoning abilities.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nThis study aims to explore a less-investigated aspect\\nof LLMs: within LLM reasoning, which presents\\na greater challenge — deductive or inductive rea-\\nsoning?\\nTo investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapacities of LLMs, we introduce a novel frame-\\nwork called SolverLearner. By concentrating on\\ninductive reasoning while setting aside LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning, SolverLearner can scrutinize\\nthe pure form of inductive reasoning in LLMs.\\nOur findings unveil remarkable inductive reasoning\\nprowers in LLMs through SolverLearner, achieving\\nnear-perfect performance with an ACC of 1 in most\\ncases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive\\nreasoning abilities, LLMs often exhibit weaker de-\\nductive capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” scenarios.\\nLimitations\\nLLMs cannot perform inductive reasoning over\\nall the tasks In our inductive learning setting, LLMs\\nare provided with only a limited number of contex-\\ntual examples. The goal is to infer the function that\\naccurately maps inputs to outputs based solely on\\nthis constrained dataset. In order to solve this prob-\\nlem, it is significant that we can find a unique func-\\ntion satisfied given these examples. For instance, a\\nlinear function can be precisely determined given\\njust two data points, as it has a singular solution.\\nHowever, attempting to deduce a quadratic curve\\nfrom two points poses an insurmountable challenge\\ndue to the existence of infinite functions capable\\nof passing through those specific points. Addition-\\nally, LLMs might struggle to discern the correct\\nmapping function when the search space of the\\nproblem expands excessively. Consider the case\\nof arithmetic tasks; without limiting the search\\nspace to finding a suitable base that aligns with\\nthe observations, the task becomes overwhelmingly\\ncomplex. This is because the search space could en-\\ncompass any conceivable rule that accommodates\\nthe observations.\\nThe effectiveness of LLMs’ inductive reason-\\ning capability is heavily reliant on the founda-\\ntional model While GPT-4 consistently showcase\\nimpressive inductive reasoning abilities through\\nSolverLearner and achieve perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 across all the tasks, GPT-3.5 strug-\\ngle to learn the correct input-output mapping func-\\ntion in several cases. This observation suggests\\nthat the inductive reasoning potential of LLMs is\\nsignificantly constrained by the underlying model.\\nChain of Thought (COT) has not been incor-\\nporated into the comparison Chain of Thought\\n(COT) is a significant prompting technique designed\\nfor use with LLMs. Rather than providing a direct\\nanswer, COT elicits reasoning with intermediate\\nsteps in few-shot exemplars. This method was not\\nincorporated into our comparison as it is viewed\\nas a technique to improve the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs. Although COT has proven to\\nbe effective across various tasks, numerous studies\\nhighlight a significant performance gap that COT\\nstill needs to bridge to achieve flawless execution.\\nEthical Considerations\\nThe authors foresee no ethical concerns with the\\nresearch presented in this paper.\\nReferences\\nMaciej Besta, Nils Blach, Ales Kubicek, Robert Ger-\\nstenberger, Lukas Gianinazzi, Joanna Gajda, Tomasz\\nLehmann, Michal Podstawski, Hubert Niewiadomski,\\nPiotr Nyczyk, et al. 2023.

These expressions are\\ndrawn from bases 8, 9, 10, 11, and 16, with sepa-\\nrate sampling for each base. Importantly, all the\\nexpressions have been carefully chosen to yield\\ndistinct results when evaluated in their respective\\nbases, thereby distinguishing them from one another\\nduring the process of rule learning.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In accordance with\\nthe methodology outlined in Wu et al.’s work (Wu\\net al., 2023), we have generated a set of 100 simple\\nthree-word sentences (e.g., “bob likes bananas”)\\nwith five different word order variations (e.g., “ba-\\nnanas bob likes” in OSV format). Subsequently,\\nwe tasked LLMs with learning how to manipulate\\nsentence order. It’s noteworthy that we took great\\ncare in selecting words to ensure that each word in\\na sentence can only fulfill one specific role, such as\\nsubject, object, or verb. For instance, we ensured\\nthat sentences like “bob likes anna” were excluded,\\nas both “bob” and “anna” could potentially serve as\\nboth subjects and objects, violating this constraint.\\nSpatial Reasoning The spatial reasoning dataset\\nintroduced in Wu et al.’s paper (Wu et al., 2023)\\nconsists of 100 rooms that were randomly selected,\\nand each room contains three distinct objects. The\\nspatial directions within these rooms are represented\\nusing unit vectors. For instance, north is represented\\nas (0, 1), south as (0, -1), east as (1, 0), and west\\nas (-1, 0), with a y-axis pointing upward serving\\nas the default orientation. In our study, we have\\nmodified the mapping between directions and unit\\nvectors and tasked LLMs with learning this new\\ndirection-to-unit vector relationship. We explore\\ntwo direction-swapped scenarios (north-south and\\neast-west), three rotated scenarios (by 90°, 180°,\\nand 270°), and a randomly permuted scenario. The\\nprimary metric we report is instance-level accuracy,\\nwhich necessitates that all three objects within a\\nroom must be correctly positioned in order to be\\nconsidered accurate.\\nCipher Decryption We’ve generated a collection\\nof 100 pairs of strings (e.g., “Mrxuqhb -> Journey”\\nfor Caesar Cipher) for each of three cipher systems,\\nincluding the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. Each pair\\ncomprises an encrypted string (e.g., “Mrxuqhb”)\\nand its corresponding decrypted version (e.g., “Jour-\\nney”). By providing LLMs with several examples,\\neach containing an encrypted string alongside its\\ncorresponding decrypted counterpart, the primary\\ntask is to accurately determine the cipher system\\nemployed in an open-world context.\\nA.1.2\\nFew shot Example Generation\\nThe preparation of examples for few-shot learning\\nfollows a straightforward process. We divide all the\\ndata into a training set and a test set, from which few-\\nshot examples are extracted from the training set.\\nThese few-shot examples are automatically prepared\\nby associating queries with their corresponding\\nground truth answers using a pre-defined template.\\nA.1.3\\nTest Case Generation\\nIn the function execution phase, the test cases are\\ngenerated using a template without involving LLM.\\nIn particular, the test cases are drawn from the test\\ndata files, containing all the queries along with\\ntheir correct answers (e.g., “76+76 = 174”). When\\nthe LLM is used for generating code, we specify\\na function interface, such as def solver(n1: str,\\nn2: str) -> str. Then, using the query examples\\nprovided, like “76+76 = 174”, we create test cases\\nby applying this function interface to the query (e.g.,\\nsolver(76,76)), thereby eliminating any reliance on\\nLLM for this process. This method ensures that our\\ntest case generation is 100% correct.\\nA.2\\nFull Prompts\\nWe provide the prompts that we used to query the\\nLLMs for all tasks in Tables 1 to 4. We do not use\\nthe system message field for any model.\\nA.3\\nFull Results\\nWe show the full numerical results in Tables 5 to 8.\\nIn addition to using 8-shot examples, these results\\nalso include experiments with 16-shot examples\\nto assess how changes in the number of in-context\\nexamples impact the results.\\nA.4\\nMore Results on Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclu-\\nsion, we have included additional LLMs, claude-\\n3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted as\\nClaude3. We show the full numerical results in\\nTables 9 to 12.\\nA.5\\nAblation studies\\nLLMs struggle as executors when applying\\nlearned functions. To better demonstrate the de-\\nductive capacity of LLM, we present both GPT-3.5\\nand Python with identical code and task them with\\napplying the code to deduce the same set of queries.\\nAs shown in Table 13, while the Python interpreter\\ncan be considered an oracle, delivering flawless\\nperformance, it proves challenging for LLMs to\\naccurately execute the code.\\nLLMs can learn the function with very few\\nexamples when the inductive reasoning problem\\nis well defined.\\nTo examine the impact of the\\nnumber of few-shot examples on the inductive rea-\\nsoning capability of LLMs, we vary the number of\\nin-context examples within [1,2,4,8,16] and assess\\nperformance on the spatial reasoning task using\\nGPT-3.5 as presented in Table 14. We observe that\\neven with very few examples, GPT-3.5 can still\\nlearn the mapping function if it is learnable.\\nTable 1: Prompts for the Arithmetic Task.\\nMode\\nPrompt\\nZero-shot\\nYou are a mathematician.

      "Generative AI pornography or simply AI pornography is a digitally created pornography produced through generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Unlike traditional pornography, which involves real actors and cameras, this content is synthesized entirely by AI algorithms.

      "== History ==\n",
      "The use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI's release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI's warnings against sexual imagery, SD's public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\n",

      "=== AI-generated influencers ===\n",
      "One application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\n",
      "By 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\n",
      "The growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\n",
      "OpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI's mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\n",
